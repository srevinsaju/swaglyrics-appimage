Continuous AppImages for Swaglyrics

> NOTE: This is not an official release of swaglyrics. This is a custom / modded version of swaglyrics made so that it can 
work with AppImages without errors. Do not raise issues at the organization, if it doesn't work. Raise issues here and I will 
be happy to help. Thanks!
